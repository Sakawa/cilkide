# Cilktools package

This package is designed to help programmers using the Cilk threading library keep track of their race conditions as they are writing code in Atom. The plugin will automatically run cilkscreen in the background and report the results to the users, notifying them if race conditions appear.

## Setting up the package
In order to notify the package that you are writing a project with Cilk, you must place a configuration file `cilkscreen-conf.json` in the top-level directory of the project. You should also have a Makefile present in that directory so that the package can build the project. The configuration file should have two settings: `makeCommand` and `commandArgs`:
```JSON
{
  "makeCommand": ["make target-name"],
  "commandArgs": ["./executable", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
}
```
You can automatically generate a template configuration file in a folder by pressing "Register Cilk project" on the status bar. Once this is done, the package will periodically run cilkscreen on the executable generated by the Make command. The status bar icon will show the package status for the current file open.
